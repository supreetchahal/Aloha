# Update: Aloha Part 2

The main focus of the second phase of the Aloha project was the incorporation of Flexbox and JavaScript.
* Flexbox was extremely useful as it replaced the floats and presented the webpage with a clean and easily navigable layout.
* JavaScript gave the webpage interactivity. The Flickity plugin provided smooth navigation through the product lineup.

Additionally, the second phase of the product gave me an opportunity to improve project 1 by using semantic HTML classes, implement accessibility features like skip link, restructure and DOM and CSSOM to improve performance, practice proper code indentation and fix media queries.
